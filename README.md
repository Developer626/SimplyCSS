# SimplyCSS
A CSS library for making building templates easier by using CSS grid.

The goal of the library is to make it easy to customize the look of a web page and its sections without making it difficult to setup, by taking a programmers approach. Common settings will be created for the use of less coding.

Other features of CSS will be added, because grid is not the only useful part of the CSS3.

This is an Alpha build and things will most likely break.
